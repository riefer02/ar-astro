Today is January 13. I'm feeling burnt out by all the news—all this new technology disrupting people's lives, and how the people who control that technology are attempting to create, or have already successfully created, a new caste of humans. That's rather dramatic, I know. But it feels like right now there's no real way to advance as a society or as an individual.

In this moment, I was thinking about how we millennials have experienced something special: the emergence of a globalized earth thanks to digital technology. This is profound, and it's something we have to bring awareness to—because I think it calls for a new world order to develop, for human society to prevail and coexist with planet Earth.

Starting a revolution seems hard. But when you break it down to fundamentals, we have to spread a message. The best way to do that is still by publishing literature—writing blogs, sharing them online, and talking to each other in person. That's the only real way we're going to connect. Digital social spaces aren't good places for these conversations anymore because of bots, which account for so much spam and noise in today's society.

The technocratic society right now is not egalitarian in any way—it's only increasing the divide. Our government is lagging behind. Policies over the development of AI technology need to be geared toward the benefit of the greater population, not just those who already have access.

This gets back to our special understanding of how the world now works, and the limited resources planet Earth has. People just trying to make a profit need to get the fuck out of the driver's seat. People are willing to harm one another for the value of a dollar. That's how desperate we've become.

What's happening in the United States is a symptom of something deeper—a human poison, the dying breath of an ego-driven old world order. Because if you look at the whole planet Earth, this is our home. Everybody deserves a meaningful life and the ability to explore this beautiful world.

The current status quo is not acceptable. I'm proposing we hit the books—in a good way—and find a way to make it all work for the working man, for people, for everyone. Technology needs to be accessible. It's about accessibility. The government's role should be improving accessibility to a quality way of life.

I know you might perceive me as boiling these issues down to simplified things. I have no worry about that. They are complex—I know this. However, I believe the power of the human individual on a cognitive level is potent enough to start a reaction in that cognitive network we share.

Thanks for reading. Ciao.
