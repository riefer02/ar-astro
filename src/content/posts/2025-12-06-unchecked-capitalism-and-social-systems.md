In this post, I want to discuss a critical topic: how capitalism, when left without government oversight, can destroy the social systems that support the majority of people.

<!-- TODO: Flesh out the content here based on your thoughts. -->

just yesterday musician friend of mine William king of billy king in the bad bad bad posted a Instagram story about how spot fies CO had been investing in AAI drone weaponry technology. This really shocked me for a lot of reasons the main one just being that the fact that this wasn't illegal the second one being the fact that this wasn't ethical and then the fact a did this meant that just humans as a whole are really okay with continuing to kill one another and make a profit off of it I mean none of those are more important than the other they are all important and I honestly think that's really fucked up. And this all is just like what does the government even do for people I mean just humans I mean seriously homo sapiens like what does it really do for them as a species I really asked myself this question. Because it's like if there's there's one job that's the government's job it's to make the lives of its citizens better bottom line everyone everyone comes along on that ride and jest the fact that it's not doing that and it's not even it even has its interest in making a profit off the war machine just I mean this is revolutionary outcry at this point like humans are just so desensitized that they don't see this as just something that needs to immediately get shut down. There's that term american hegemony and it's just rampant and it's like everyone born into this capitalist society has an infection of the mind and the only way to cure it is to think critically and our government is systematically robbing us of ways to achieve that bide destroying education so once again I ask you what is the government doing this is a revolutionary outcry I feel like there's no other thing to say just about this level of imagined order that's absolutely toxic to the majority of humans on planet earth. I mean I understand that all of you reading this might think it's controversial and I'm just glossing over some details but I think really it just comes down to fundamentals in the core of the issue where are you building your lifes on and the government is one of those foundational pieces and government are a part of our culture and I'm personally one hoping for a global culture with less tribalism between nationalities especially when you look at the fact that there's no more earth to discover on the surface \* I mean just it is what it is I guess but I mean I'm just getting too old and fed up and what I'm seeking is a human species that is less focused on fucking each other over and the only way we're going to achieve that is by educating people connecting people sharing creating community building honor stewardship vision ambition and listening to those who have less so that we can work to build everyone up to a better baseline and making sure life is still fulfilling and exciting but not at the expense of others it's not a zero sum game all of these things everything even my opinion they're all just imagined orders however the question is what do you want to imagine I honestly thank john Lyndon knocked it out of the ballpark when he wrote the song imagine and yeah he's a funny dude but I'm feeling pretty inspired by that so I just want you to ask yourself what is the government doing if you know someone in government were if you're a part of the government or you say things like I don't want to do and have to do anything with the government the government is you the government is our banker they're holding our social cultural money and they're not lending it out to everyone they're withholding us on education withholding on preserving the beauty of our land all for profit all for a dollar bill an imagined order it has no sense of anything but somehow it tickles our homo sapien brains who've been poisoned with the dreams of capitalism and even further back the dreams of total control the dreams of total luxury. I truly think that we can have a better government we can have more transparency we can have better officials clearer policy simpler systems to understand for people we can improve education we can help rebuild communities I'd think we have the power and the resources. There's a quote from gandhi the world has enough for everyone's need but not for everyone's greed I see it it's there I believe it and these days everyone's feeling the squeeze from the capitalist oligarchy and the government shutdown of its own people ability to live and quality of life I think I'll wrap up with that thank you and dog speed.
