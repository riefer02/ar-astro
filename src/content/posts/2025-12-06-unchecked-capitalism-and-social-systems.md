In this post, I want to discuss a critical topic: how capitalism, when left without government oversight, can destroy the social systems that support the majority of people.

Just yesterday, a musician friend of mine, William King of [Billy King and the Bad Bad Bad](https://billykingandthebadbadbad.com/), posted an Instagram story about how [Spotify’s CEO has been investing in AI drone weaponry technology](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/daniel-eks-prima-materia-invests-100m-in-defense-ai-startup-helsing/). Three things that should never go together. This really shocked me for a lot of reasons. The main one being the fact that this wasn't illegal. The second one being the fact that this wasn't ethical. And then the fact that this meant that humans as a whole are really okay with continuing to kill one another and make a profit off of it. I mean, none of those are more important than the other; they are all important, and I honestly think that's really fucked up.

And this all is just like... what does the government even do for people? I mean, just humans—seriously, Homo sapiens—what does it really do for them as a species? I really asked myself this question.

Because if there is one job that is the government's job, it's to make the lives of its citizens better. Bottom line, everyone comes along on that ride. And just the fact that it's not doing that—and that it even has an interest in making a profit off the war machine—I mean, this is a revolutionary outcry at this point. Humans are just so desensitized that they don't see this as something that needs to immediately get shut down.

There's that term, American hegemony, and it's just rampant. It's like everyone born into this capitalist society has an infection of the mind, and the only way to cure it is to think critically. Yet, our government is systematically robbing us of ways to achieve that by destroying education. So, once again, I ask you: what is the government doing? This is a revolutionary outcry. I feel like there's no other thing to say about this level of [imagined order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind) that's absolutely toxic to the majority of humans on Planet Earth.

I understand that all of you reading this might think it's controversial and that I'm just glossing over some details, but I think it really just comes down to fundamentals and the core of the issue: what are you building your lives on? The government is one of those foundational pieces, and government is a part of our culture. I'm personally hoping for a global culture with less tribalism between nationalities, especially when you look at the fact that there's no more Earth to discover on the surface.

I mean, it is what it is, I guess. But I'm getting too old and fed up. What I'm seeking is a human species that is less focused on fucking each other over. The only way we're going to achieve that is by educating people, connecting people, sharing, creating community, and building honor, stewardship, vision, and ambition. We need to listen to those who have less so that we can work to build everyone up to a better baseline, making sure life is still fulfilling and exciting, but not at the expense of others. It's not a zero-sum game.

All of these things—everything, even my opinion—they're all just [imagined orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind). However, the question is: what do you want to imagine? I honestly think John Lennon knocked it out of the ballpark when he wrote the song "Imagine." Yeah, he's a funny dude, but I'm feeling pretty inspired by that.

So, I just want you to ask yourself: what is the government doing? If you know someone in government, or if you're a part of the government, or if you say things like "I don't want to have anything to do with the government"—the government is you. The government is our banker. They're holding our social and cultural money, and they're not lending it out to everyone. They're withholding education from us, withholding the preservation of the beauty of our land—all for profit. All for a dollar bill, an imagined order. It has no sense of anything, but somehow it tickles our Homo sapien brains, which have been poisoned with the dreams of capitalism, and even further back, the dreams of total control and total luxury.

I truly think that we can have a better government. We can have more transparency, better officials, clearer policy, and simpler systems for people to understand. We can improve education; we can help rebuild communities. I think we have the power and the resources.

There's a quote from Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed." I see it. It's there. I believe it. And these days, everyone's feeling the squeeze from the capitalist oligarchy and the government shutdown of its own people's ability to live and enjoy a quality of life.

I think I'll wrap up with that. Thank you, and Dogspeed.
