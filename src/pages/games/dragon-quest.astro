        <h2>About This Game</h2>
        <p>
          This is a simple proof-of-concept built with React and TypeScript, demonstrating 
          basic game mechanics like character movement, collision detection, animations, 
          and object interactions—all without any external game engines!
        </p>
        
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Smooth 4-directional movement with WASD or arrow keys</li>
          <li>Animated attack system with visual feedback</li>
          <li>Interactive objects you can examine</li>
          <li>Collision detection with walls and objects</li>
          <li>Dialogue system for storytelling</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <p>
          Built using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef), 
          requestAnimationFrame for the game loop, and CSS animations for visual effects. 
          The entire game is self-contained in a single component with no external dependencies 
          beyond React itself.
