# Blog post filename convention

All blog markdown files in `src/content/posts/` must begin with the publish date in `YYYY-MM-DD-` format, followed by a short, hyphenated slug.

Examples:

- [2025-04-30-checking-in.md](mdc:src/content/posts/2025-04-30-checking-in.md)
- [2025-06-27-korea-japan.md](mdc:src/content/posts/2025-06-27-korea-japan.md)

Guidelines:

- Use lowercase and hyphens; avoid spaces and special characters
- Keep slugs concise and descriptive
